#360 Tracker

This application is a part of a code challenge submitted to the Nerdery.
----=----+----=----+----=----+----=----+----=----+----=----+----=----+----=----+
This is a front-end for an application which displays Xbox 360 games which we 
currently own, as well as the games we would like to buy, and the number of 
votes for buying each of those games. Employees can vote for their favorite
games or add new games to this list, once per day. If we meet our productivity
goals then each week the game with the most votes wil be purchased and we'll
update the list accordingly.

The application (a) displays the games we own, (b) displays games that we want
to own, and lets you vote on them, (c) allows you to submit new titles for 
voting, and (d) allows you to designate a game as owned by us.

The backend does not have a user architecture, so the frontend implements the
security restriction of at most 1 vote/day. Please don't cheat.
